## Ingredients
1. Pork ribs (baby back or spare ribs)
1. 2–3 lemons (zest + juice)
1. Freshly ground black pepper (generous)
1. Salt (to taste)
1. Olive oil
1. Garlic (optional, minced or powder)
1. Fresh herbs like thyme, oregano, or rosemary (optional)

## Instructions
1. Prep the ribs:
    * Remove the thin membrane from the back of the ribs (this helps them stay tender).
    * Pat them dry with paper towels.
2. Season:
    * Rub the ribs with olive oil.
    * Season generously with salt, black pepper, lemon zest, and a bit of garlic if you like.
    * Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the ribs.
3. Marinate (optional but recommended):
    * Let them sit covered in the fridge for 1–2 hours (or overnight) so the lemon and pepper flavors soak in.
4. Bake:
    * Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C).
    * Wrap the ribs tightly in foil (to trap steam and keep them tender).
    * Place on a baking sheet and cook for 2.5–3 hours until the meat is tender and pulls away from the bone.
5. Finish:
    * Unwrap the ribs, brush with a little more lemon juice mixed with olive oil.
    * Broil or bake uncovered at 450°F (230°C) for about 10 minutes to get a golden crust.
6. Serve:
    * Sprinkle with extra fresh lemon zest and herbs before serving.

If you like them saucier, you could make a lemon-pepper glaze with honey or butter and brush it on during the last 10 minutes.

# Extra 

# Lemon-Pepper Glaze (for last 10 minutes)

## Ingredients
* 3 tbsp fresh lemon juice
* 1 tsp lemon zest
* 2 tbsp honey (or maple syrup if you prefer)
* 1 tbsp melted butter (or olive oil)
* 1–1½ tsp freshly ground black pepper (to taste)
* Pinch of salt

Optional kick: add a pinch of chili flakes or cayenne if you like a little heat.

## How to Use It
1. While the ribs finish their slow bake (still covered), mix all glaze ingredients in a small bowl.
2. After the ribs are tender, remove foil and drain off extra liquid from the Pyrex.
3. Brush the glaze generously over the ribs.
4. Return to the oven uncovered at 450°F (230°C) or under the broiler for 8–10 minutes, until the glaze caramelizes and turns glossy.
5. Brush once more after removing for extra shine.

The honey/butter balances the sharp lemon and pepper, giving you that sticky, flavorful crust without overpowering the ribs.
