My wife wants to visit her brother in UK, and I had the to see what were the requirements to get in.  By the way it was very easy for my nationallity.   This is only a rough guide, at least to see where did you get it., it will be very diffent for each case.


1. Find the requirments, visit [https://www.gov.uk/standard-visitor](standard-visitor).

2. Check if you need a visa to visit the UK: go to [https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa](check-uk-visa).

From my country and going as a tourist, it showed me: 

> "You'll need an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) or a visa" 

3. Apply for an ETA: [ETA apply](https://www.gov.uk/eta/apply).

I downloaded the IOS app, which was very easy and got the ETA in less than an hour.  Impressive!
